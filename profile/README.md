### Who

We are a community of developers creating and maintaining projects related to classic Tomb Raider titles.

### Why

At the time of Lost Artefacts' inception, we feel our fan base is very fragmented and that it's difficult for the average person to discover and track the community's projects and initiatives. Lost Artefacts was created as an attempt to change this state of affairs and centralize most of projects so that fans can get clear and simple information about projects from one place.

### Joining us

If you are interested in joining us and transferring your project to this organization, please contact @rr-. We guarantee that we won't mess with your projects. The only expectation from our side is for you and your contributors to be civil in comments if you choose to keep an Issues and/or Wiki sections in your project.
